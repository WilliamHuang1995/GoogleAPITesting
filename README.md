## Quickstart for using Google API on plain old java
 Personal use only.
 I've created this repository solely to practice and test API calls and such.<br>
 The initial commit is from the tutorial:<br>
 https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/quickstart/java<br>
 On a scale from 1 to 10 in terms of following the steps, I'd say this was an easy 3 given you have enough experience with IDEs and such. <br>
 If you are actually thinking of cloning this repo, note that I did everything on JetBrains IntelliJ, so you might as well import the project from VCS and do some stuff with Gradle. I still am a bit iffy with Gradle but slowly picking it up.
